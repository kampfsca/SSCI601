# Central Themes
## Primary Objectives

- *Provide new data on the characteristics of a broad set of neighborhoods and health studies over the past 20 years as a resource to better un-derstand the state of the “neighborhood effects on health” science*
- *Reflect on previous agendas to advance neighborhoods and health research, highlighting goals that have not yet been met by the existing literature*

# Methods

## Central Themes

:::::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.6\textwidth}"}

- Cross-Sectional studies are abundant
  - Other designs are much needed to address confounding
- Census Geographies abound
  - Are study hypotheses truly *a-priori*
  - Convenience sampling
- GIS-related topics are often overlooked, as other commonplace statistics
   - MAUP
   - 3+ Level Modelling
   - Spatial Relationships
- Concentration on just a few topics

# Interdisciplinary Connections \& Evaluation
## Interdisciplinary Connections \& Evaluation

**Interdisciplinary Connections**

- Incorporating Neighborhood elements connects people to space
  - GIS elements, Demography, Public Health Epidemiology

**Evaluation**

 - Limited to multi-level modelling
 - A good review of the current state of the literature
  - Identifies common themes, areas for future progress

# Questions
## Questions

- What are your thoughts on the Cross-Sectional Observational study of neighborhood effects? Is it completely overplayed at this point?
- What are some other approaches to compliment/contrast/improve multi-level modelling with neighborhood effects?
- Is this field of work getting more technical and deductive?
